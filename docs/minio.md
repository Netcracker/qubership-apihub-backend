Minio (S3-compatble storage) is used for string relatively big binary files like build results.

Apihub is accessing minio via API, but you can access it via built-in web UI.

Console (web ui) access: 
https://console.apihub-minio.s3.qubership.org/login

For credentials ask BE team lead or management(or you can get it from Apihub-BE k8s secrets if you have access).
